**I am doing this to get more comfortable with Go.** It's not perfect, and I compare my answers to others _after_ I've completed the puzzle.

## Running

To try a day from the root of this repository, run

```
./run <dayXX> <1|2>
```

This essentially changes the directory to `<dayXX>` and runs `go run main.go`, which takes either a '1' or '2' and runs the corresponding part.
